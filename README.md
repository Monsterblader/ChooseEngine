# A choose-your-own-adventure-game engine

I used an Angular.js boilerplate for this task.  It comes with two views.
I chose Angular because its data binding and built-in ability to loop over data sets were very convenient for displaying and editing all of the available passages.
I used an array as my data structure because Angular could handle it very easily and require minimal coding.
I considered a tree or graph for my data structure, but parsing and rendering those would have required more time.  I did search for libraries to handle that, and I found that someone created a directive to parse and display trees.  It looked pretty good, too.  If I were to redo this task, I might try that directive.
I got part way through handling changing a passage's parent and did not get to hiding the data for each passage in edit mode.
